    <p>
        Some definitions of methodology include:

        "the analysis of the principles of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline";[10]
        "the systematic study of methods that are, can be, or have been applied within a discipline";[10]
        "the study or description of methods".[11]

        The methodology underlying a type of DNA sequencing.
        The natural sciences (astronomy, biology, chemistry, geoscience, and physics) draw their study of methods
        through the scientific method.[12] This is a quantitative approach influenced through the philosophy of
        empiricism that posits knowledge (see epistemology) can only be obtained through direct, verifiable
        observations. The scientific method offers a defined set of best practice to observe the world through
        established methods such as characterizations, hypotheses, predictions, and experimentation. A key
        distinguishing feature of this methodology is that it sets out not to prove knowledge, or facts, "right", but
        rather it primarily sets out to prove something "wrong" or false (see falsifiability). A cornerstone of this is
        the null hypothesis that states there is no connection (see causality) between whatever is being observed. That
        it is the researcher's position to do all they can to disprove their own hypothesis through relevant methods or
        techniques, documented in a clear and replicable process, to such an extent that they can disprove the null
        hypothesis and therefore accept the alternative hypothesis that there is a relationship between what they have
        observed.[13]

        The social sciences derive their study of methods from a broader continuum of methodologies (e.g. qualitative
        research) than the natural sciences do.[14]

        Methodology has several related concepts: paradigm, algorithm, and method.

        The methodology is the general research strategy that outlines the way in which research is to be undertaken
        and, among other things, identifies the methods to be used in it. These methods, described in the methodology,
        define the means or modes of data collection or, sometimes, how a specific result is to be calculated.[15]
        Methodology does not define specific methods, even though much attention is given to the nature and kinds of
        processes to be followed in a particular procedure or to attain an objective.

        When proper to a study of methodology, such processes constitute a constructive generic framework, and may
        therefore be broken down into sub-processes, combined, or their sequence changed.[16]
    <p>
        <h1 id="paradigm">PARADIGM</h1>
        
    <p>
        A paradigm is similar to a methodology in that it is also a constructive framework. In theoretical work, the
        development of paradigms satisfies most or all of the criteria for methodology.[17]
    <p>
        <h1 id="algorithm">ALGORITHM</h1>
        
    <p>
        An algorithm, like a paradigm, is also a type of constructive framework, meaning that the construction is a
        logical, rather than a physical, array of connected elements.

        Any description of a means of calculation of a specific result is always a description of a method and never a
        description of a methodology. It is thus important to avoid using methodology as a synonym for method or body of
        methods. Doing this shifts it away from its true epistemological meaning and reduces it to being the procedure
        itself, or the set of tools, or the instruments that should have been its outcome. A methodology is the design
        process for carrying out research or the development of a procedure and is not in itself an instrument, or
        method, or procedure for doing things.

        The economist George M. Frankfurter has argued that the word method is not interchangeable for methodology, and
        in contemporary scientific discourse is a "pretentious substitute for the word method".[18][full citation
        needed] He argues that using methodology as a synonym for method or set of methods leads to confusion and
        misinterpretation and undermines the proper analysis that should go into designing research.[18]
